# Day 1: Reflection
## I had a great first day in my Electronics for the Rest of Us module, in which I got to learn how to utilize basic functions Arduino and GitHub through the exercises through the YouTube videos posted on the Inspire 1A03 webpage. I was interested in this module because I have not taken an electronics or computer science type course since grade 11. Although I found these courses quite fascinating in the underlining codes and functions that were necessary to run programs and other electronics, for whatever reason I never really continued to pursue this field. Leading to a degree in Communications and Political Science, I have yet to have the opportunity to take a computer or electronics type course since grade 11. “Electronics” is a broad word that has actively become a large part of the 21st century’s society. I was unsure of what we were going to endeavour in these modules when I selected it as my first choice for week three, but thought it would be a good idea to gain some insight into what it would have to offer. There’s no better way to practice an interdisciplinary learning style in learning how to exercise the tasks demonstrated in these modules. After day 1, I am looking forward to continuing the multifaceted platform of GitHub and learning how to create circuits using the Arduino.
